Subject: [PATCH v11 28/28] misc: nnpi: Tag channel objects with creator
 user-id and privileged tag

Allow the device SW stack to reject certain host requests based on the
requestor user identity. This is done by tagging each channel with
the user-id and privileged flag when the channel is created.

This is used for the follwing:
1) When host application queries for some card resource status, card
   SW stack will hide resources that was created by different user,
   unless the requestor is privileged.
2) When host application request to change device settings that will
   affect all users, card SW stack will reject the request if the
   requestor is not privileged.
