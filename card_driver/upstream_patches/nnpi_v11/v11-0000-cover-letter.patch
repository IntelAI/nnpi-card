Subject: [PATCH v11 00/14] misc: nnpi: New PCIe driver for Intel's NNP-I pcie device

Hi,

This version 11 of the NNP-I driver patch set sent internally
before submitting out to Greg KH.

In this version many of the driver functionality has been removed,
Only the minimum required for a dummy inference user-space application
is left. Such dummy inference application does use all the data flows
that a real inference application uses.

The dropped features will be added on a later phase, after this minimal
path-set will be uploaded.

The dropped features are listed below.

Changes in v11:
   - Fixed comments from v10
   - Removed the following features, reducing the size of the patch-set:
      - Sysfs visibility
      - Handling of device errors
      - Visibility to static device system info (total memory, ice count, steping, ...)
      - Access to device crash log
      - BIOS capsule update
      - enable/disable device for new inference contexts
      - PCIe reset and error handling
      - Visibility to device post code and bios flash progress
      - Ability to get more command queue BW for inference contexts comparing to nnpiml channels
      - Device hang detection
      - PCIe error injection
      - Host SW traces
      - Support host resources from dma-buf objects (created by another driver)
      - Block non-privileged users to do any nnpi_ctl commands and query SW counters of ALL contexts.

Changes in v10:
   - removed bitfield in unions from protocol (using bit masks instead)
   - renamed function names to be more consistant
   - changed logical/pci "layers" to be called device and HW layers.
   - removed host resource allocation method from IOCTL. Support only pinning user memory.
   - re-wrote most of the commit messages
   - fixed errors reported by lkp

Changes in v9:
   - fixed potential dead-lock in boot load flow
   - IOCTL structs alignment issues
   - sysfs - one value per-attribute
   - code-style: func arguments and multi-line alignment
   - sparse errors reported by lkp

Changes in v8:
   - broke the most of the big patches to little smaller ones.
   - Reviewed and fixed all comments from v7.

Changes in v7:
   - Added documentation sections to many structs and functions.
   - Added "Terminology" section to Documentation/misc-devices/intel-nnpi.txt
   - Removed use of function pointers with interface to PCIe "h/w layer"
   - Fixed IOCTLs backward compatability support.
   - Patch#13 has removed - ipc s/w counters
   - Patch#15 has removed - handling PCIe link-down in absense of pciehp
   - Byteorder consideration - Fixed data packets sent to the device to be
     in little-endian. Other communications with the device is through
     mmio which is little-endian anyway.
   - Removed sysfs "reset" attribute
   - Removed sysfs attribute which outputs application pids.
   - Fixed and cleaned all other comments.

Changes in v6:
   - lkp build fixes
   - fixes build errors when tracing is enabled
   - made trace compiled by default, define NNP_DISABLE_TRACE to disable.
   - fixed reviewed-by tag to mention first name before last name.
   - serialize pcie reset and remove flows.
   - rebased on top of current linux master

Changes in v5:
   - Makefile fix for out-of-tree builds
     (added $(srctree) when specifying include path)

Changes in v4:
   - Per Dave-Hansen suggestion, abandon patch#20
     (misc: nnpi: Added hostres_min_order module parameter)
     Realized that the benefit it brings not worth the risk.
   - Fixes build failures found by lkp
   - Some bug fixes found in v3
   - Clean W=1 build warnings

Changes in v3:
   - Few small BUG fixes found during testing
   - Add device bios update flow - boot flow has changed to allow
     booting the device either with OS boot image or bios capsule image.
     The device bios will start bios update if capsule image is used.
   - Fixed comments from previous version

Changes in v2:
   - used --strict flag to checkpatch.pl, only left CHECK comments which
     will break the 80 chars line length limit if fixed.
   - removed CONFIG_DMA_SHARED_BUFFER ifdefs
   - moved high order page allocation optimization to separete (last) patch
   - removed device list array
   - removed all c++ style comments

Thanks,
Guy.
